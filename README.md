# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is an AI-based project developed using Python. This system suggests movies to users based on their preferences and watching history. It leverages various machine learning techniques to provide personalized recommendations, making it a valuable tool for movie enthusiasts.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests movies based on user preferences and viewing history.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to those the user has liked in the past.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses data from multiple users to recommend movies.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for improved accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For experimentation and visualization.

## Dataset
- The system uses publicly available movie datasets such as the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
- Ensure the dataset is downloaded and placed in the correct directory.

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: Loads movie data and user rating data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts features for content-based filtering.
4. **Model Training**: Trains collaborative filtering models using user rating data.
5. **Recommendation**: Combines results from both models to provide movie recommendations.
